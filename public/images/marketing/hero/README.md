## Custom hero images (Onboarding + Welcome/Home)

Place your onboarding/welcome background images in this folder using these filenames:

- `beach-sunrise.jpg`
- `forest-trail.jpg`
- `mountain-overlook.jpg`
- `mountain-clouds.jpg`

They are referenced by the app as:

- `/images/marketing/hero/beach-sunrise.jpg`
- `/images/marketing/hero/forest-trail.jpg`
- `/images/marketing/hero/mountain-overlook.jpg`
- `/images/marketing/hero/mountain-clouds.jpg`

Notes:
- Use 1920×1080 (or larger) for best results.
- JPG or WEBP works; if you prefer WEBP, update `src/assets/marketing/heroBackgrounds.ts` accordingly.
